Each of these .rs files is an indentation test.  For each one, an ERT test will read it, strip its existing indentation, and then use rust-mode's indent feature to re-indent it.  If it's working properly, that should result in the same string as the original file.  In other words, each file here is indented the way we want the emacs mode to indent rust code, and the ERT tests verify that.
